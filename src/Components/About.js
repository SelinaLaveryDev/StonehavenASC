          <h2>Get Involved</h2>
          <p>Volunteers are the lifeblood of any club, and SASC is no different. We are run by volunteers who do everything to make the club run smoothly.</p>
          <p>The club Committee meets regularly and would be delighted to see some new faces at their meetings - itâ€™s a great way to be involved in the decisions that impact your swimmer.</p>
          <p>By signing your child up to join SASC, you are also making a commitment to get involved in the running of the club.</p>
		  <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
      <p>Swimmers and parent members are asked to sign a Code of Conduct to help ensure the safety and enjoyment of all swimmers and volunteers.</p>
      <h3>Welcome</h3>
      <p>We look forward to welcoming you and your swimmer to SASC and to getting to know you and your family. If you have any questions, please contact our Membership Secretary at sascnews@hotmail.com</p>
