        <p>Nobody can do everything, but everyone can do somethingâ€¦
</p>
        <p>Stonehaven Amateur Swimming Club is entirely volunteer run, from the committee to the coaching team, who volunteer and give up their time freely to assist with the running of our club. We rely heavily upon our dedicated volunteer workforce, without whom, the club would not survive.</p>
